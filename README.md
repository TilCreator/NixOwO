# NixOwO
Cuter Nix logo (SVG)

I took the probably handdrawn chibi Nix logo from [here](https://github.com/TheDarkBug/uwufetch/blob/main/res/nixos.png) and traced it in Inkscape.

The plain version should be used for web and similar. The wip version still has the helper layer and a few other extras for editing. The last version is missing the helper layer, but still has some Inkscape data.
